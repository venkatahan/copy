It is typically used in voice interactions where customers are prompted to press a number on their phone keypad to select an option or provide input.\n\nThe slot is configured to accept only valid DTMF tones and will ignore invalid entries such as *, or #. It is designed to work with natural voice or keypad input, supporting multi-modal interaction for IVR-like workflows.","slotTypeValues":[{"synonyms":null,"sampleValue":{"value":"1"}},{"synonyms":null,"sampleValue":{"value":"2"}},{"synonyms":null,"sampleValue":{"value":"3"}},{"synonyms":null,"sampleValue":{"value":"4"}},{"synonyms":null,"sampleValue":{"value":"5"}},{"synonyms":null,"sampleValue":{"value":"6"}},{"synonyms":null,"sampleValue":{"value":"7"}},{"synonyms":null,"sampleValue":{"value":"8"}},{"synonyms":null,"sampleValue":{"value":"9"}},{"synonyms":null,"sampleValue":{"value":"0"}}],"parentSlotTypeSignature":null,"valueSelectionSetting":{"resolutionStrategy":"TOP_RESOLUTION","advancedRecognitionSetting":null,"regexFilter":null}}
